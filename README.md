# Water
This repository contains an implementation which demonstrates a set of the basic rendering techniques used for water rendering. 
The implementaion covers the following:
1.	Reflection and refraction
2.	Simulation of water movement
3.	Fresnel effect
4.	Specular lighting
5.	Caustics

The implementation also includes a "Pan and Zoom" camera which allows moving around and zooming in. 
You can compile the project either by opening it in IntelJ IDEA or using maven. 
If you choose to use maven you also need to download the dependencies (also using maven) and do not forget to include them in the classpath.
Here are some pictures.
