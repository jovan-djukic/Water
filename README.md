# Water
This repository contains an implementation of the basic water rendering techniques. 
The implementaion covers the following:
1.	Reflection and refraction
2.	Simulation of water movement
3.	Fresnel effect
4.	Specular lighting
5.	Caustics

You can compile the project either by opening it in IntelJ IDEA or using maven. 
If you choose to use maven you also need to download the dependencies (also using maven) and do not forget to include them in the classpath.
Here are some pictures.
